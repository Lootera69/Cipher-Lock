## Features

### Base64 Encoding/Decoding

Easily convert text to and from Base64 encoding. Base64 encoding is commonly used for data encoding and transmission.

### Caesar Cipher

Implement the Caesar Cipher, a classical substitution cipher. Encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

### XOR Encryption

Perform XOR (Exclusive OR) encryption and decryption. XOR is a bitwise operation that provides a simple yet effective form of encryption when applied to plaintext and a secret key.

### AES Encryption

Utilize the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure symmetric encryption. Choose from key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt messages.

### DES Encryption

Experience the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric encryption algorithm with a fixed key size of 56 bits. DES operates on 64-bit data blocks.

## Getting Started

4. **View Result:**

    Review the result presented in the designated output area.

## Algorithms

### Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### XOR Encryption

XOR encryption (Exclusive OR encryption) is a bitwise operation that applies the XOR function to each bit of the plaintext with the corresponding bit of the key.

### AES Encryption

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely adopted for its security and efficiency. It uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

### DES Encryption

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm with a fixed key size of 56 bits. It operates on data blocks of 64 bits.
